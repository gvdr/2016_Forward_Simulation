# 2016_Forward_Simulation

## Project to be develped during the 2016 Nantucket Bootcamp

### Simulating the evolution of interaction networks under different scenarios

- Plant-seed dispersal networks
- Projection networks (apparent competition)
- Discrete and continuous scenarios (new links appearing only at
  speciation events or with probabilities along the branches)
- Creating edge lists with links, logical for existance, branching
  times.
- Allowing the user to choose between different scenarios
  (preferential attachment, nested networks, modular networks,
  competitive interactions)
